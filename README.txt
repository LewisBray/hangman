Hangman game that is displayed in command prompt.  The program first reads in a text file (called "words.txt") with words/phrases in the format of one word/phrase per line e.g.,

liberal
aftermath
this is a phrase
I am a programmer

and stores each line in a vector.  A random word is selected from the vector every time the user initiates a game.  The user is allowed up to 6 mistakes every game.  When the game is over the user is asked if they would like to play again.

The program was made to practice classes again as well as implementing file streaming.
